# Layoffs-Data-Cleaning-Project-MySQL-
This SQL-based data cleaning project focuses on a dataset containing global company layoff records. Using MySQL, I cleaned and transformed raw CSV data to prepare it for accurate and efficient analysis. This is part of a hands-on portfolio series intended to strengthen SQL data wrangling skills for real-world business use cases.
